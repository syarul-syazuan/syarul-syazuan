Hi, I’m @syarul-syazuan, an Honours Physics student with a strong interest in theoretical physics, axions, dark matter, and particle physics.
I’m currently learning advanced data segmentation techniques and exploring new ideas in cosmology. 
I’m open to collaborations on research projects related to dark matter, axions, and computational physics. 
You can reach me at ssm115@uclive.ac.nz
